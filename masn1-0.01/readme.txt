This package is a masn1 source snapshot of an early pre-alpha release.

Visual Studio solutions can work with additional tweaks. As I have migrated to linux I will not fix these .sln's. Next release will be a Mono release, with GNU Makefile for building binaries.

mASN1 is released under MIT license.
